This is a fast walkthrough, just the commands you need to give in order to reach the end of the game.

(If you want a more thorough guide on how to maneuver in the game and where to find the pieces to the puzzle, read huijausTeksti.txt)

Press Enter 4 times ( skip intro )

commands to give:

wakeup
go corridor
go murder cabin
interrogate martin
interrogate martin (you can replace both of these with liemann, but you need to interrogate the same officer)
yeas
martin (here you need to write the killer's name, the game will end no matter who you write but you won't win if you get it wrong)

(the correct answer for the killer can be found in the code inside directory 'ui' inside TextUI.scala on line 51.
